Frequently Asked Questions
--------------------------

Q: Should I really read the file HINTS.TXT?
A: Yes! Of course!

Q: I'm in the first level, and already see large sections I can't access!
Is that a bug? Maybe a secret?
A: No. In this level, there are skill-specific sections:
One accessible in easy skill, another one in medium, and a few others in hard.

Q: I can't cheat! How can I?
A: Cheats are disabled as I want to avoid the reveal of spoilers using cheats.
If you really want to cheat, find by yourself how to :P

Q: Is there any secret level?
A: Yes. In fact, there are two. 
I'd call these "The Secret Level" and "The Super Secret Level" :P

Q: Any hint which may help me finding a way to any secret level?
A: For the first one, it's like in Ceilick's "Dead in the Desert" MOD,
but less obvious.
For the second one, try looking for a hint by yourself.
It may be a bit hard to notice it, but it's there.
