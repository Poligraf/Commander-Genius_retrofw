Episode VI Mini-MOD

Aliens Ate My Babysitter
...Again
 
As Keen's babysitter
gets kidnapped again,
Keen enters the BwB
megarocket. Its screen
tells him to fly to the
so-called Blog Planet.
Upon landing, he attempts
to gather some more info,
finding out the BwB
is malfunctioning.
 
Getting out of the BwB,
he feels like he's in a
familiar place...
And, he could see thirteen
cyan things, with a few
instructions telling,
"Twelve for energy".
"Hmm...it may help me
fixing the BwB",
he wonders.
