Hints for the Mini-MOD "Aliens Ate My Babysitter... Again"
----------------------------------------------------------

* When you see that blinking sign looking like a stop sign
(with the hand on it), it can be a sign of some kind of a danger being nearby.

* Mainly on the hard skill, but sometimes on medium too - save ammo!
I counted how much ammo you need in each level, at least on the hard skill.
Of course, if you feel like you must use ammo for something, use it.
But in general, save as much as you can.
Oh, and of course, it's good to save ammo on the easy skill as well,
although you should have more ammo and less hazards. 

* Have you wondered what happens right after you get out of a door, assuming
you then encounter a hazard? Do you think Keen will just die immediately?
Well, that's not the case. After getting out of a door, Keen gets some unknown
source of invulnerability, protecting him from hazards,
for a period of one second.

* There are "one way" blocks, controlling in which direction can you go.
Some of these blocks can be flipped with a switch.

* Most of the cheats are DISABLED. One main reason for this, is to decrease the
chances that spoilers are revealed not in the intended way (without cheats).
If you really want to enable some cheat... well, find by yourself how to :P
