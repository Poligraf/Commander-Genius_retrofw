Lets cover the actions you can do in the game (the keys mentioned are the defaults when you first play the game).

Commander Keen can:

RUN LEFT/RIGHT
Use the left and right arrow keys to move Keen.

GET STUFF
You can get things simply by walking into them.

JUMP
Press Ctrl to make Keen jump. (This is button 1 in joystick control.)

POGO
Press Alt to use your pogo stick. You can jump higher with it, but it is harder to control. Press Alt again to stop using it. (This is button 2 in joystick control.)

SHOOT
Press the space bar to fire your Neural Stunner. It will fire in the direction you are facing.

OPEN DOOR
Doors need gem-shaped keys to open. Simply walk into the door when you have the correct gem.

Find the EXIT sign in each level to complete them.

ADVANCE MOVES
There are several moves available that may help you get to those "impossible-to-reach" places. Here they are:

IMPOSSIBLE POGO TRICK
If you run left or right, then quickly press Pogo and Jump in succesion, you will blast off at an angle.

MID-AIR POGO
You can pull out your pogo stick in the middle of a normal jump, giving you good control for that first jump.

COOL JUMP
In many places you will see a big arc of candy. These are usualy set up so you can get them in one cool jump.

There are other difficult moves, but we'll let you figure them out on your own.

       Enchanter Soda (100 points)

       Peppermint (200 points)

~Cast of Creatures

      Foes abound on the planet Haunterra.  Fortunately for keen, many are nocturnal or not found on this side of the planet.  Heres a list of the creatures Commander Keen will encounter on this adventure:


	ENCHANTER.  Very powerful creatures, known throughout the Universe for their great knowledge, mystic capabilities and of course their prisons. Unfortunatly for Keen they don't like trespassers.

    Frenzied Fungi. These plants hop about with no particular destination in mind. They won't hurt keen, but since they're in a hurry to get nowhere they won't think twice about pushing him around.

	Grin. These friendly guys always where a smile. They'll push Keen around and can easily become an annoyance. A blow to the head should stun them long enough get past them, though.

    Moonon. Fish-like creatures who inhabit the various lakes and rivers of Haunterra, whose heads are shaped like a crescent moon. Since Keen doesn't have any swimming gear on this pursuit, you won't need to worry about these guys.

    Mossrot. This creature looks like an old rotten stump. It pushes keen around and shoots deadly moss out its long nose.

	  Shocky.  It is deadly to touch and shoots electromagnetic nets which will stun Keen and throw him around a bit.

	Womp-A-Chomp. These blue, three eyed creatures don't walk, or run. They just kinda "womp" around. They have been known to charge their prey, so be wary.

That's all, now go find Mortimer!
